# Weeks of Pregnancy Calculator Plugin

The Weeks of Pregnancy Calculator Plugin is a WordPress plugin that calculates how many weeks pregnant a user is based on their last period date. The plugin also displays important information about the baby's development based on the current week of pregnancy.

## Requirements

This plugin has been tested with WordPress 6.1.1 and PHP 8.1. Please ensure that your WordPress installation meets these requirements before installing the plugin.

## Usage

To use the plugin, simply add the `[semanas_de_embarazo]` shortcode to a post or page. This will display the form where the user can select the date of their last period.

After submitting the form, the plugin will make an AJAX call to calculate the current week of pregnancy and display the relevant information about the baby's development.
